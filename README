Tester memory is the most expensive part of the chip. This is compelling semi-conductor market to store as less test data as possible in the tester memory. Compression of test data involves many challenges, namely, huge amount of vectors that need to be compressed and the close inter dependencies in the merging capabilities of the vectors. To resolve this issue many approaches have been analyzed, viz, static  merging, dynamic merging, decision tree based merging, clustering the test data and clique merging within test data graph networks. Some methods showed inconsistent behavior while few like decision tree based merging and clique merging were consistent across varied test cases. With the help of clique merging approach 8X compaction of test data was achieved on IP module LINFLEX.
